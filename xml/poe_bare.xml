            <head>Annabell Lee</head>
            
            <lg>
                <l>It was many and many a year ago,</l>
                <l>In a kingdom by the sea,</l>
                <l>That a maiden there lived whom you may know</l>
                <l>By the name of Annabel Lee;</l>
                <l>And this maiden she lived with no other thought</l>
                <l>Than to love and be loved by me.</l>
               
            </lg>
            
            
            <lg>
                <l>I was a child and she was a child,</l>
                <l>In this kingdom by the sea,</l>
                <l>But we loved with a love that was more than love—</l>
                <l>I and my Annabel Lee—</l>
                <l>With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven</l>
                <l>Coveted her and me.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
                <l>And this was the reason that, long ago,</l>
                <l>In this kingdom by the sea,</l>
                <l>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</l>
                <l>My beautiful Annabel Lee;</l>
                <l>So that her highborn kinsmen came</l>
                <l>And bore her away from me,</l>
                <l>To shut her up in a sepulchre</l>
                <l>In this kingdom by the sea.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
                <l>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,</l>
                <l>Went envying her and me—</l>
                <l>Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,</l>
                <l>In this kingdom by the sea)</l>
                <l>That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</l>
                <l>Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
                <l>But our love it was stronger by far than the love</l>
                <l>Of those who were older than we—</l>
                <l>Of many far wiser than we—</l>
                <l>And neither the angels in Heaven above</l>
                <l>Nor the demons down under the sea</l>
                <l>Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</l>
                <l>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</l>
            </lg>
            
            <lg>
                <l>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams</l>
                <l>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</l>
                <l>And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes</l>
                <l>Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</l>
                <l>And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</l>
                <l>Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,</l>
                <l>In her sepulchre there by the sea—</l>
                <l>In her tomb by the sounding sea.</l>
